    This view takes care of handling the gaming part of the website. If the request comes as a GET, we serve the page

    in our system, so it makes perfect sense to handle this request by POST. We do not enforce POST to be performed
    via Ajax, but we'll only return JSON data via the post.
    For every request, we also check the user owns the game, before doing everything else.
